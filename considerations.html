    <h1>Important Considerations and Limitations</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Biological and Analytical Variability of Glucose- and Insulin-Based Measures</h2>
      <p>
        Although this tool applies defined cutoffs for impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),
        1-hour post-load glucose, the insulinogenic index, and first-phase insulin release, both glucose- and insulin-based
        measures are subject to important sources of biological and analytical variability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the RISE study, 354 adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent repeat standardized
        OGTT testing after six weeks. Reproducibility was only moderate, with concordance rates of 75.4% for fasting glucose and
        60.7% for 2-hour post-load glucose, demonstrating that glycemic classification itself may change on repeat testing.
        <sup><a href="references.html#ref2">2</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, insulin concentrations exhibit substantial assay-dependent variability across laboratories. Commercial insulin
        immunoassays show excellent within-assay precision but large between-assay differences, with deviations from LC-MS reference
        values ranging from −298 to +303 pmol/L (equivalent to −49.7 to +50.5 µU/mL).
        <sup><a href="references.html#ref3">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these biological and analytical sources of variability underscore that glucose and insulin-derived indices should be
        interpreted as relative risk markers rather than absolute thresholds, and always in the context of the donor’s demographic and
        metabolic profile.

      <h2>2. Variability of Metabolic Syndrome Components</h2>
      <p>
        Metabolic syndrome is an important component of the proposed risk assessment tool. However, many of its components demonstrate
        intraindividual biologic variability (CVb).
      </p>

      <!-- RESTORED missing bullet list (removes the stray dash issue) -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          One study reported average CVb values of 7.4% for HDL cholesterol and 22.6% for triglycerides.
          <sup><a href="references.html#ref4">4</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          For blood pressure, within-individual variability assessed by ambulatory monitoring showed coefficients of variation of 5.4% for
          daytime systolic blood pressure and 6.1% for daytime diastolic blood pressure, with higher variability during nighttime measurements
          (7.0% and 8.4%, respectively).
          <sup><a href="references.html#ref5">5</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          In normoglycemic individuals evaluated over several consecutive days (mean fasting plasma glucose 4.9 mmol/L [88 mg/dL]),
          within-subject coefficients of variation for fasting plasma glucose—used in ATP III metabolic syndrome classification—ranged from
          4.8% to 6.1%.
          <sup><a href="references.html#ref6">6</a></sup>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because several components can vary meaningfully within an individual, metabolic syndrome classification may change on repeat assessment,
        especially when results fall near diagnostic cutoffs. When metabolic syndrome status is central to counseling or decision-making, consider
        confirming borderline components with repeat measurement and interpret findings in the context of overall cardiometabolic risk.
