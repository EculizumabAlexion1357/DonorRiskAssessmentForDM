    <h1>Important Considerations and Limitations</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Biological and Analytical Variability of Glucose- and Insulin-Based Measures</h2>
      <p>
        Although this tool applies defined cutoffs for impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT),
        1-hour post-load glucose, the insulinogenic index, and first-phase insulin release, both glucose- and insulin-based
        measures are subject to important sources of biological and analytical variability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the RISE study, 354 adults with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent repeat standardized
        OGTT testing after six weeks. Reproducibility was only moderate, with concordance rates of 75.4% for fasting glucose and
        60.7% for 2-hour post-load glucose, demonstrating that glycemic classification itself may change on repeat testing.<sup><a href="references.html#ref2">2</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, insulin concentrations exhibit substantial assay-dependent variability across laboratories. Commercial insulin
        immunoassays show excellent within-assay precision but large between-assay differences, with deviations from LC-MS reference
        values ranging from −298 to +303 pmol/L (equivalent to −49.7 to +50.5 µU/mL).<sup><a href="references.html#ref3">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these biological and analytical sources of variability underscore that glucose and insulin-derived indices should be
        interpreted as relative risk markers rather than absolute thresholds, and always in the context of the donor’s demographic and
        metabolic profile.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Variability of Metabolic Syndrome Components</h2>
      <p>
        Metabolic syndrome is an important component of the proposed risk assessment tool. However, many of its components demonstrate
        intraindividual biologic variability (CVb).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One study reported average CVb values of 7.4% for HDL cholesterol and 22.6% for triglycerides.<sup><a href="references.html#ref4">4</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          For blood pressure, within-individual variability assessed by ambulatory monitoring showed coefficients of variation of 5.4% for
          daytime systolic blood pressure and 6.1% for daytime diastolic blood pressure, with higher variability during nighttime measurements
          (7.0% and 8.4%, respectively).<sup><a href="references.html#ref5">5</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          In normoglycemic individuals evaluated over several consecutive days (mean fasting plasma glucose 4.9 mmol/L [88 mg/dL]),
          within-subject coefficients of variation for fasting plasma glucose—used in ATP III metabolic syndrome classification—ranged from
          4.8% to 6.1%.<sup><a href="references.html#ref6">6</a></sup>
        </li>
