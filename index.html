        This platform was created to help transplant professionals identify prediabetes in living kidney donor candidates,
        characterize its severity, and estimate future risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      </p>
<p data-seo-copy>
        A clinician-facing web calculator to support evaluation of <strong>living kidney donor</strong> candidates with <strong>prediabetes</strong>.
        The platform integrates OGTT glucose and insulin timepoints (0–120 min) to compute insulin secretion and sensitivity indices (e.g., IGI, Matsuda, DI),
        and combines these with ATP III metabolic syndrome criteria to inform risk stratification and counseling.
      </p>
      <p class="small" data-seo-copy>
        Keywords: living kidney donor prediabetes, OGTT calculator, insulinogenic index, Matsuda index, disposition index, transplant donor diabetes risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        It complements the publication of our article in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em>,
        Personal Viewpoint: <em>Risk Stratification and Counseling of Living Kidney Donor Candidates with Prediabetes</em>.

        Traditional biomarkers such as hemoglobin A1c lack sensitivity for early detection of impaired glucose homeostasis.
        Many individuals with normal hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels may still be at elevated risk for progression
        to diabetes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Risk estimates generated by this tool are based on OGTT-derived glucose and insulin values, from which validated indices
        of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are calculated, and are integrated with metabolic syndrome classification
        using Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria, and hemoglobin A1c.

        <h2>OGTT Protocol Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The WHO recommends an OGTT after 10–16 hours of overnight fasting (water only).</li>
          <li>
            For ≥3 days before testing, candidates should ingest ≥150 g/day of carbohydrates, with the final pre-fast meal including ≥50 g
            (carbohydrate restriction may impair post-load glucose disposal).<sup><a href="references.html#ref1">1</a></sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            After fasting glucose and insulin are obtained, a 75 g oral glucose load is administered, and glucose and insulin are measured
            at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
